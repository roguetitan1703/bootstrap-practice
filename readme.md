# 📋 My First Blog Website with Bootstrap! 💫

## 📝 Description

I just hosted my first blog website, built entirely using Bootstrap! It's a simple template for anyone wanting to launch a tech blog. The main reason I built it was to get a grasp on Bootstrap's components and functionalities. Bootstrap provides well-designed components like carousels, modals, cards, and footers, and their simple styling with class names helped me achieve the look I envisioned. It was definitely rewarding. More web development projects are definitely in the pipeline!
